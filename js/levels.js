        The floor is made of tiles with scattered colored stones ‚Äî mostly red, with a few green, and even fewer blue and yellow ones. 
        You notice that if you step on more than three stones of the same color, a low humming sound comes from the floor ‚Äî almost like a warning.
        A phrase is etched above the center of the room:
        "Too much of one color will cloud your path."`,
